# Perlin Noise Flow Field (in Processing)

This is a quick little experiment I did playing around with perlin noise and flow fields in Processing. 
The project consists of two files:

- particle.pde
- flow.pde

## particle.pde
- The _particle.pde_ file is a class that reprsents a particle object. It is quite simple only involving two instance variables, the current position and the velocity of the particle. Included are methods to update the position based on a new velocity generated by two dimensional perlin noise, and to display the particle to the screen. 

## flow.pde
- The _flow.pde_ file is the driver program that makes use of the _particle_ object, and puts together the animation. 
 
Below are some sample frames from the flow animation.
